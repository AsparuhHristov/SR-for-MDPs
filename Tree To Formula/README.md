These programs translate the output of the SR algorithm to a readable mathematical formula. 

More precisely, the output of the SR algorithm is a evolutionary program and is used as an input to TreeDecoder.

With TreeDecoder one also simplifies the expression by using the sympy package.

The SymbolsDecoder turns the labeled features (X0, X1, etc.) into the desired name. Note that currently it is hardcoded as it is simply used once and it is case specific.
